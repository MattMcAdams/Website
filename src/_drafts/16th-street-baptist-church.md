description: "This collaborative project between UAB’s Bloom Studio and Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church was an exploration in the church’s past, present, and future brand. In addition to crafting a campaign message and refreshed logo, we also looked at how the brand would play out in merchandise and advertisements. The final deliverable was a strong message, consistent brand, and a host of design assets each with an art control number."

Stronger Together captures the spirit of the church’s community and symbolizes their endurance through the civil rights movement. It embraces the past but looks to the future.

The refreshed brand’s aesthetic is steeped in history but looks to a bright future. The grey tones pay tribute to the past while the orange pops out of the palette and symbolizes a bright future.

The logo mark is the culmination of everything the church is about, and everything they want to achieve in the years to come. The mark is framed in a circle, a shape close to the heart of the congregation and symbolizes unity. Elements of the church’s architecture were incorporated into the mark with a modern silhouette.
