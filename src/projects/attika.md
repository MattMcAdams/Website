Attika is an exploration of typographical design through technological advancements introduced in OpenType Variable Fonts. The typeface is a bold and versatile humanistic sans-serif typeface suitable for headlines and display text. It is roughly inspired by itâ€™s namesake, a region of Greece home of Athens, a haven of philosophy and democracy in the ancient world.
