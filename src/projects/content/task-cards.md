I like stationary and making stuff with paper. I also love being organized, and wasing as much time as possible to become organized. This pair of traits led me to creating these task cards. I should also say these are heavily inspired by [Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog).

The **Today** card has a short list of actionable items, designed to help you focus on just a handful of key priorities. It has a little area for notes under the tasks, as well as a pomodoro tracker.

The pomodoro technique is where you work for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break. You repeat this for 4 sets of working segments then take a 30 mintue break.

The **Next** card is to help organize whats on the horizon. Maybe these are tasks that need your attention, but they're not designated for today.

The **Someday** card is for items you need to remember or get around to at some point, but they generally have no deadline and are not critical.

Every card features a dot grid back for notes.
