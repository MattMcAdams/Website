Branching out speaks to anything that takes you in a new direction. Birmingham Botanical Gardens’ new program “Branch Out” wants to create an opportunity for anyone with a curiosity of plants to do just that. Whether you are already a seasoned gardener, have a basic understanding of plants, or are just interested in giving back to your community, “Branch Out” allows you to do something new.
