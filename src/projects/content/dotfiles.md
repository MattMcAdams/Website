Dotfiles are something few people care about, but they hold all of the configuration settings for key systems. Heavily modified setups need to be backed up and this also allows us to quickly get back up and running with a new computer.

My dotfiles holds my git configuration and some extensive modifications to zsh, many of which I [talk about in my blog](/posts/2023/displaying-git-info-on-prompt/). It may not seem like much, but this is a project close to my heart and brings me a great deal of joy.

There's much more information about this project over on [GitHub](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/dotfiles).
