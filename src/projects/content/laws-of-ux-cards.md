I'm a huge fan of the [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) website by Jon Yablonski. I think its a great resource for designers learning about user experience.

I made these flash cards as a companion piece for myself, a coworker, and a designer friend of mine, and I thought you might could use them too.

I printed these on 110lb cardstock and cut with my Cricut. Then, I folded them over with some craft glue to keep them together and rounded the corners with my corner cutter. This makes for a really thick and stiff card.
