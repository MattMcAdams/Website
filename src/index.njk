        <h1>Hi, I'm Matt McAdams</h1>
        <p>I’m a Web / UX Designer with a BFA from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a focus in graphic design. When I’m not pecking at code or pushing pixels, I like to explore fantasy worlds in books and video games.</p>
        <p>I’m an advocate for creating a more accessible and inclusive web through thoughtful design and great experiences. On this website, you can see my design work, code projects, and read my thoughts on technology and design.</p>
