# 18 February 2024

This week has been a busy one.

I decided to revert our WordPress theme back to classic templates from the block editor. [This was not without its problems](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58898). We decided to leave `index.html` alone for the time being to give users time to migrate.

I've also released a tool for generating color scales, which I'm calling [Colorful](https://color.mattmcadams.com). This was a lot of fun to build and I learned a lot of new things about javascript. For example, when comparing objects you need to `JSON.stringify` them first otherwise you might get a false negative. I also learned that you can accidentally modify the value of a `const`.

This week I also made the first major update to my website in about a year. Adding more projects and expanding the scope of projects. I also added several meta pages to make my little corner of the web feel more personal, this journal being one of them.

I haven't gotten much done in terms of reading this week. I've had to be on campus in person on Valentine's Day and I've been feeling under the weather since then. I've been far too inspired to build things too.

I hope to write a log here each week, but I know I've never been great at keeping up with tight content generation schedules, so we'll just see how it goes.
