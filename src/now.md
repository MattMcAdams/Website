# Now

A periodically updated, high level overview of what I'm currently doing, experimenting with, learning, reading, or am otherwise interested in.

## Occupation

I am currently working as the Associate Director of Web Strategy at The University of Alabama

## Learning

Thanks to work, I'm learning a lot more about WordPress and the Customizer. The majority of my development work for UA has been in the design system, but I've wanted to get more familiar with how our WordPress theme works too.

Outside of work, I'm learning more about [Open Data](https://0data.app/) and how I can implement it in my own apps.

## Reading

I'm currently reading *I'm OK - You're OK* by Thomas A. Harris. It's a book about Transactional Analysis, which is a theory of personality and a systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and personal change.

## Down Time

In my down time, I'm watching *Spy x Family* and playing with my [color palette generator](https://color.mattmcadams.com), Colorful.

## Interests

I'm currently really interested in sustainable and portable technology. I recently watched a really cool [talk at Strange Loop by Devine Lu Linvega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3u7bGgVspM) that has had me really inspired.
