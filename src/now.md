# Now

A periodically updated, high level overview of what I'm currently doing, experimenting with, learning, reading, or am otherwise interested in. For my semi-weekly check-ins, take a look through my [adventure log](/log).

## Occupation

I am currently working as the Associate Director of Web Strategy at The University of Alabama.

In this role, I handle the day to day operations of our development team, as well as run a community forum centered around web development at the University. My favorite part of my job is helping developers across campus achieve their goals with the products our team creates and maintains.

## Learning

Thanks to work, I'm learning a lot more about WordPress and PHP. The majority of my development work for UA has been in the design system and React component library, but I've wanted to get more familiar with how our WordPress theme works too.

Outside of work, I'm learning more about [RemoteStorage](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js) and how I can implement it in my own apps. I'm also learning more about Linux and have a few projects in mind for a small home server.

## Reading

I'm currently reading *I hate you, don't leave me*. It is a book about Borderline Personality Disorder, which is a condition of one of my loved ones.

## Down Time

In my down time, I'm playing with my [color palette generator](https://colorscale.app), ColorScale. I'm currently playing *Elder Scrolls Online* and *Genshin Impact*.

## Interests

I'm currently really interested in sustainable and portable technology. I recently watched a really cool [talk at Strange Loop by Devine Lu Linvega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3u7bGgVspM) that has had me really inspired. I've been looking into [permacomputing](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html) as a result of my recent delves into this internet rabbit hole.
