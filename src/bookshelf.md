# Bookshelf

A directory of what I've read and recommend others read, ordered by the year I read them. I used to not read a lot and in 2024, I made a resolution to read at least 12 books a year, so this page is also an attempt at accountability.

If you're interested in this, you may also like my [quotes page](/quotes) which is a catalog of interesting quotes I've come across.
