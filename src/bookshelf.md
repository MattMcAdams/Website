# Bookshelf

A directory of what I've read and recommend others read, ordered by the year I read them. I used to not read a lot and in 2024, I made a resolution to read at least 12 books a year, so this page is also an attempt at accountability.

## 2024

- *The Creative Act: A Way of Bring* &mdash; Rick Rubin

## Earlier

- *Typography* &mdash; Denise Gonzales Crisp, William F. Temple, Thames and Hudson
- *Tales from the Loop* &mdash; Simon Stalenhag
