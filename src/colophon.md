# Colophon

This site is a small static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The pages are written in either markdown or nunjucks. I write all of my content in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), and develop this website with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For hosting, I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). My domains are all registered through [Hover](https://www.hover.com/), but I generally use Netlify's DNS. This website's code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/mattmcadams.com).</p>

Other tools I use as part of my daily workflow are:

- [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)
- [Bear](https://bear.app/)
- [Procreate](https://procreate.com/)
- [Prospect](https://jaromvogel.com/prospectapp)
- [Numi](https://numi.app/)
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)

On a more personal note, I've also written up a list of my personal affects in the form of a [what's in my bag](/objects) style post.
