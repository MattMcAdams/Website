As I’m wrapping up my winter break, I’m looking toward the new year and all the opportunities it presents. My biggest goal this year is to be more intentional in how I spend my time.

I’m starting with building routine and structure. Work and home life have usually played tug of war and this year I want to set clear boundaries for work time, home time, and time for creativity. I haven’t nailed down the specifics just yet, but that’s what I hope to accomplish over the month of January.

I want to make sure I have time every week for the following:

- Creative exploration and expression
- Work & professional development
- Exercise and physical activity
- Social activity
