It’s been an eventful week at work. One of our sites got compromised so this is the first real cybersecurity incident I’ve been involved in containing. Thankfully we have a whole cybersecurity team I was able to call in and they’re pretty much handling it from here.

We’ve done a lot of home improvement projects lately so I’m very tired haha. I don’t do well with manual labor and I’m not particularly handy other than being able to put together furniture. Still, it’s nice to have a lot of annoyances patched up.

Outside of work I’ve started playing *Genshin Impact* again, which has been fun. There’s so much new content from the last time I played so I’m sure it’ll keep me busy for a while.
