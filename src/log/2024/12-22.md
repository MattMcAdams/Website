This was the last week of work before the holiday break. It was a very chill week and I got a lot accomplished so that we're on track to hit the ground running when we return in 2025.

I've also found some inspiration and energy to put toward creative pursuits. I spend several days this weekend making stickers with my Cricut, did a few studies to get warmed back up to drawing and published a new sketch [Ley Lines](/sketchbook/2024/ley-lines/). I also took some time this week to finally write a post about [imposter syndrome](/posts/2024/on-imposter-syndrome/), which is something I've been meaning to do for several years.

In addition to my creative activities, I've added an easter egg to this website that I've had on my mind for a really long time.

<p>If you press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> you'll find a little terminal inspired interface</p>

The terminal accepts a handful of commands (help is a good place to start), none of them really do anything, as this is a static site after all, but I thought it was a really fun idea and it was a lot of fun to build. I want to expand on the commands available so that you can adjust a few CSS variables with it, or use it to navigate the site.

This was the first time I've used class based JS, so I got to learn about the basics of that, and I'm now much less intimidated when I come across other code using that style.

Copilot also helped me out a good bit, saving me several trips to google and performing code manipulation that would have been too tedious for me to bother with. Overall, I'm impressed by my new coding companion.

If there's enough interest, I may write an article about building it.
