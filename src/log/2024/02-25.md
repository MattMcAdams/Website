Finally recovered from whatever flu or cold I've been fighting for the past week, so I've been super full of energy. Taxes are also done, so that's off my chest.

I've pushed a huge update to my [color tool](https://color.mattmcadams.com) adding a library and organization features. I learned about reading and generating json files so that was really neat.

This week I also created a new leather notebook for a smaller size that can [fit in my bag](/objects). The paper size for the new notebook is A6.

I've finished reading *I'm ok -- You're ok* this week, but I'm still thinking of what I want to read next. My husband wants me to read *I hate you, don't leave me* so I may do that next.

Work continues on getting comfortable with Procreate and drawing in general again. The brush customization is really remarkable and I've continued to tweak my pencil brush to feel as natural as possible. I kept having an issue where, when shading, if I would lift the pen and put it back down it would create dark lines where they overlapped. Thankfully I was able to fix this by adjusting the opacity settings in the brush itself.
