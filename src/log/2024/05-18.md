Last weekend was a ton of fun. It wasn’t the best con experience I’ve had but I’m glad I was able to go and soak in the incredible energy.

As for work, it’s been difficult to get back into the saddle this week, between my brain being stuck in vacation mode and then coming down with a light cold. Progress on the new directory with Azure is going very slowly.

I finished *Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End* this week. Absolutely incredible anime. I really hope they make more.
