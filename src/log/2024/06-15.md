A week full of meetings, but I enjoy talking to people and helping them solve problems so it was a good week in my opinion.

I helped one of my friends move to Nashville, and while moving is never fun we had a pretty good time hanging out and moving boxes.

In my free time I'm still playing AC Valhalla and trying to get caught back up on my reading goals.
