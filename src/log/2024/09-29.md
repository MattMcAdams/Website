I used recursion for the first time this week, which made me feel like a proper developer haha. I’ve always hated the concept because it was so difficult for me to wrap my head around when I was learning Javascript years ago. I never had a legitimate use case for it, so I had always written it off. Today I found myself thinking “this is actually a good case for recursion, let me see if I can sort out how to do it properly” and I got it right on my first try!

In my down time, I've been watching *Vinland Saga* and just finished it today. I hope they make another season because its been really good so far. Other than that, I've been building factories in *Astroneer*.

I'm making some lifestyle changes to be healthier, mostly just trying to eat cleaner and more healthy foods. I'm trying to get back into reading and working on creative projects too.
