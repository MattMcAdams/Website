Hmm. lets see... This week I updated this website with more feed options. You can see them all on the [feed index](/feed). I've also published a [new post](/posts/2024/11ty-prev-next-links/) covering how I did the previous and next links you can see at the bottom of this page.

Oh, this week I created an account on Gumroad to host my free typefaces. [Go check it out](https://mattmcadams.gumroad.com/)!

My husband asked me where I see myself in 5 years and honestly? I'm not sure. I used to have a Plan but lately I think I've just been floating along, surviving week by week. I'm just thankful to have gotten my creative inspiration back.

In my down time, I've put *Spy x Family* on hold while picking up *Metallic Rouge* which I'm really into. The soundtrack is really nice and *Falling Starlight and Moonlight II* has been stuck in my head all week. It just has a really nice lo-fi cyberpunk feel that I find really enjoyable. Lyrics attached below.

<pre>
I see fallen stars and moonlight
I feel a glow in my heart
When I saw you
I loved you from the start
-- from the start

I see a sun thats always shining
blocking out neptune or mars
A light so blinding baby
it compares to the stars

The stars in your eyes
looking out at a world, so blue
I can't imagine my life without you
-- without you

Here's to the moonlight
Here's to the stars that shine
when you're near me
When the stars fall its forever
in a starlight world with you
</pre>
