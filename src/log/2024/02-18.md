Work continues on the WordPress theme refactor at UA and we now have a working prototype of the new templates.

I've also released a tool for generating color scales, which I'm calling [Colorful](https://color.mattmcadams.com). This was a lot of fun to build and I learned a lot of new things about javascript. For example, when comparing objects you need to `JSON.stringify` them first otherwise you might get a false negative. I also learned that you can accidentally modify the value of a `const`.

This week I also made the first major update to my website in about a year. Adding more projects and expanding the scope of projects. I also added several meta pages to make my little corner of the web feel more personal, this journal being one of them.

I haven't gotten much done in terms of reading this week. I've had to be on campus in person on Valentine's Day and I've been feeling under the weather since then. I did start a new anime this week, *Spy x Family*. I'm only a handful of episodes in, but it seems like a clever set of characters and I'm interested to see what trouble they get up to.
