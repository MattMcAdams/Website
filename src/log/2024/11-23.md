Toward the beginning of this month, my team started working on one of the tasks we'd always talked about. The problem we wanted to solve was that users had no clear way to report bugs with our product, and when they did manage to email us about it or post about it in our support chat, we were often missing key information needed to reproduce the issue.

For a long time, we had played with the idea of setting up a bug report form and directing people to that, but figuring out how to get people to the form and other challenges kept this in the ideas box.

During our November in-person meeting, we brainstormed ways to make the support flow easier for the users, developers, and support agents. We decided to build the bug report form but have it embedded in the product's admin dashboard. Because the form would be inside the product, we could gather all kinds of technical diagnostic data along with it. In addition to this supercharged bug report form, we built out a general support tab that contained frequently requested resources.

The team has wrapped up development on this feature and it's set to launch with the next feature update when we return from winter break in 2025.

Not the typical log, but I'm really excited about this feature. The team did a great job of executing the vision and the UI looks even better than our mockups.
