Its been interesting to see how my consistency keeping up these log entires has gone. I enjoyed writing every week, and would like to resume. To be honest, I've struggled a lot with burnout and depression the past few months. I've not really done much that has seemed worth writing about, so I've let time go by with few updates.

I'm starting to get out of my slump and have a few exciting things in the works. I'm also making plans for next year, putting more emphasis on thoughtful use of my time, lowering the time I spend staring at screens, and exploring a wider array of creative outlets.

I've finished a few drawings and am editing the longest post I've ever written. It'll be quite the departure from my usual technology and design articles, but hopefully someone out there will find it interesting.

Other than that, I recently re-watched *Russian Doll* on Netflix. I haven't seen season 2 and I don't plan to watch it. In my opinion, it only needed 1 season.

The future of these logs is uncertain. I'd like to stick to a routine, and next year I plan to be much more structured with my time, so maybe I'll keep it up for another year. I'm also rethinking how these logs fit into my content strategy, and what I want to accomplish with them.
