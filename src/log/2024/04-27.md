This week has been super busy at work. I've been in many meetings and discovered that we've got to rebuild our directory since the IT department is phasing out LDAP. We'll be moving to Azure active directory.. err I mean Entra ID now. What a weird name, I wonder how they chose it.

Otherwise everything is going pretty good. I've still been spending a good bit of time out of the house trying to find alternate work spaces for variety.
