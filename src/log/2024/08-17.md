I've really got to start offloading some of the servers I manage to their content owners. Its getting overwhelming to maintain so many sites. Everything is going well though, all builds are looking good and we should have some key updates going out next week.

In the realm of personal projects, I lost one of my clients because I needed to move them to a paid plan, but I'm not very upset about it. It's just one less thing I have to keep up with. I did however make some great progress on my [CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/CSS-Boilerplate) with a revamped layout system that I'm particularly proud of. I'll be adding some backwards compatibility for browsers that don't support the newest CSS properties down the road, along with updating this site to use the new boilerplate.

Outside of work, I've been playing *Skyrim* again, with over 300 mods of course. I actually made a couple of mods for Skyrim LE back in the day! My husband and I also watched *Neon Genesis Evangelion* this week. I had seen one of the movies before, but this was my first time watching the anime. It was pretty good, but I got bored the last 2 episodes... which is pretty common from what I've heard.
