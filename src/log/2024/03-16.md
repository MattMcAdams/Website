This week has been spring break, so I've been off work. Its been a nice vacation though we couldn't afford to go anywhere. I did get to hang out with a friend of mine in Tuscaloosa though and we had a ton of fun.

I've gotten caught up on *Spy x Family* and I hope they're making more. I didn't really look into it before I started that one. Not quite sure what to watch now!

For drawing, I've started refreshing myself on the fundamentals and found that I still have a good enough grasp on perspective and just need to get back into doing some construction from reference or life drawing. To be honest, its a little nostalgic to want to improve at my art again... I haven't seriously drawn anything really since I thought I wanted to be a commission artist back in college.

I'm kind of looking forward to work starting back. We've got a few exciting projects coming up that I'm ready to get into. I've also been playing with Microsoft Copilot and think it could be a good tool to help me write documentation by generating templates and outlines.

OH and I've decided to go back to school for my masters. I'll be taking classes at UA since I get benefits through work. I just need to write my statement of purpose, get my references together, and submit my application.
