Its been a long and busy week since we were coming back from spring break. On the up side, we released the first production build of the university web framework!

Yesterday I got to see two of my best friends for the first time in a few months and we had a great time catching up and went on a hike at Hurricane Creek. I want to make an effort of hanging out with friends more often.

This website is officially part of the [XXIIVV web ring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/#mattmcadams)! It makes me happy to be recognized and included in a group of peers I've always been really impressed by.

I've started watching *Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy* since I'm all caught up on *Spy x Family* and *Metallic Rouge*. Its pretty good so far and reminds me of *Reincarnated as a Slime*. In terms of gaming, I've been playing around in City Skylines 2. I always struggle making organic and believable road layouts though.

I think that's it for this week!
