Ugh its been a rough week with work. The business continues from last week, but more issues kept coming up. I'm thankful for the brief respite this weekend provides. The week has not been without its fair share of victories however, and I've had a good bit to celebrate.

In other news, I've found a new anime called *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End*, and its absolutely beautiful. I really enjoy how they wrote the main character as a seemingly apathetic elf who's actually very thoughtful and complex. OH and I finished *Metallic Rouge* and wow, it was so good. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi, mecha, or issues related to android rights.

No update next week since I'll be at FWA in Atlanta!
