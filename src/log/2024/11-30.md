Our IT department finally gave us full access to GitHub Copilot this week! This means we can now access the chat interface. I've been playing with it for a couple of days and I think its going to help make a lot of really tedious tasks much easier. I've had to get used to asking Copilot questions instead of going to Google though.

Outside of work, I've been watching the latest season of *Reincarnated as a Slime* which is as good as ever. I also started playing *Pokemon TCG Pocket*.
