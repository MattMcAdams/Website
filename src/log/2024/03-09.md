Almost broke a bunch of websites at work with a bad update where I had forgotten to include the meta viewport tag, so that was a fun hotfix to put out at 6pm haha. At least I knew exactly what the problem was when I saw the bug. On the plus side of work, I made our development hub more secure by making any API calls happen at build time rather than client side, then I just set up a cron job to run the build once a day.

I've created a vague content schedule for the second time in my life, hopefully I'll stick to it this time. Its basically just one post a month, one or two sketches, and four logs (one each week). I've never really kept a journal, so this is an interesting medium for me.

In other personal news, I’ve put a lot of thought into goals at my therapists recommendation. I think I’d like to stay where I am professionally, but grow more with personal projects. And I hope to eventually move into a new house closer to the city.

Oh and I started learning svelte for an RSS reader I’m building. I wanted to try something new and learn a new technology. Plus on the surface it seems more lean than next JS and react which is pleasant if not a slight learning curve.

I think that's all for this week!
