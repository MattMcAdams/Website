Our VP has finally given us permission to talk about it, so here goes - I got a new title and a slight raise at work! I'm super happy about this as the changes to the compensation structure means I have a lot more room to grow. I love working at UA, so I'm happy to see myself here for a long time.

I decided to revert our WordPress theme back to classic templates from the block editor. [This was not without its problems](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58898). We decided to leave `index.html` alone for the time being to give users time to migrate. Stakeholders seem cautious or indifferent, but no one seemed terribly upset by the news.

In personal news, I finished *Hunter x Hunter* this week. It was incredibly good, I don't know why I put watching it off for so long.

I hope to write a log here each week, but I know I've never been great at keeping up with tight content generation schedules, so we'll just see how it goes.
