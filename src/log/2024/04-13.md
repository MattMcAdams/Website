No update last week because I had cracked my laptop screen! It was my work laptop which had my development environment on it so I spent the weekend getting my personal laptop setup for dev work while waiting for a new one from work.

My hubby and I also went to Hot Springs Arkansas to see the total solar eclipse last Monday and it was absolutely stunning. It’s the second total eclipse I’ve seen but this one felt like it lasted longer and was more brilliant.

In my free time I’ve picked up *The Elder Scrolls Online* again. I was an avid fan of the game from when it was in beta and played for years but took a long break once I felt it got too grindy. It feels nice getting back into it though.
