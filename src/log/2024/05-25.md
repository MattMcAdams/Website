I’ve been sick most of this week so I’ve played a lot of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. When I was finally able to get back to work it was a busy few days as I got caught up on the development team’s progress. Not much else of note happened this week, it's been business as usual and I've been feeling rather uninspired.
