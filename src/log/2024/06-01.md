Had a lot of fun this week. The long weekend starting me off with a nice break meant we had time to go see Back to Black, which was really good. I think they did a great job of portraying Amy Winehouse. I also got to hang out with several friends and got to try homemade chocolate pudding!

Getting back to work went pretty smoothly and weâ€™ve made great progress on several of our more urgent projects this week.
