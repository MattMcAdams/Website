What a busy week. We launched 3 websites including the university home site, and made great progress on the next WordPress theme update. My boss even took me out for lunch at University Club, which was really fancy and delicious!

I've also been working on my freelance admin stuff, including new contracts, support agreements, and design process. If you're interested in getting me to build a website for you, or if you'd like to consult with me, shoot me an email and we'll chat.

I beat *Kingdom Come: Deliverance*. It was very satisfying and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next game. Other than that, I've just been keeping busy with work.
