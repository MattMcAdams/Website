Disaster strikes! Our update pipeline at work went down and unfortunately took a lot of work to get back online. Thankfully we did end up fixing it before the end of the week. We also made a breakthrough on another major project which has me pretty hyped. All that plus two releases meant it was a very busy work week.

This weekend we’re at the beach, just a day trip, to soak up some sun and splash in the Big Water. It’s a nice treat for a long stressful week.
