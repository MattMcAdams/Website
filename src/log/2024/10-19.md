I had the great privilege of attending Adobe Max in Miami Beach last week! It was a week full of fists. This was my first professional conference, the first time I’d been on a trip alone, my first time to Miami Beach, and yes, first time flying on an airplane.

I had so much fun and I learned more than I imagined. I’m not convinced that GenAI should be the future of any creative industry, but there were certainly moments where AI was a valuable tool to reduce the workload on specific tasks, such as isolating audio, and removing distractions from photos. And yes, Adobes commitment to ethical use of AI and properly sourcing their training data is reassuring. And yes, their GenAI presentations were astonishing and at times I couldn’t help but smile.

All that being said, I have this gut feeling that this technology will do us more harm than good, not just to us as creators, but I think humanity is going to lose something along the way.

Either way, it’s an exciting time to be alive and in the creative tech industry.
