Wow its bee a long time since I've written one of these, and its been incredibly busy too. This week we will launch two websites, a web app, and the new university home site. I've worked a couple of weekends this month to make sure everything is going to go smoothly, so hopefully that work pays off!

Last week I spent some time organizing my notes and reviewing my "read later" list. I've got a few ideas for some cool projects and improvements to existing projects, but nothing worth sharing just yet.

In my free time, I've been working on some pro bono work for one of my friends but I think that's about settled now too. Outside of anything remotely work related, I've picked up *Kingdom Come: Deliverance* again and am actually planning to beat it this time since the new one is supposed to come out this year. I also got into a *Need for Speed* spell for a bit and played *Heat* for a couple of weeks.

I've been wanting to get back into anime but I'm not sure what to watch. If you have any ideas, let me know!
