Personal website of Matthew McAdams.

## A brief history of my personal website

I start with a new repo each time I make major architectual changes, usually accompanied by a more drastic redesign. This is the third repository, which starts at v6, with a shift away from netlify large media and gridsome in favor of 11ty and google cloud storage.

Each major design change gets a new major version and I have kept zip archives of all previous major versions, but do not make those public.

The first two versions of my website were raw html files with a little css hosted on github pages. The next version I moved to wordpress. Versions 4 and 5 were on Gridsome and hosted on Netlify. Version 6 uses 11ty, Cloudflare, and Google Cloud Storage.
